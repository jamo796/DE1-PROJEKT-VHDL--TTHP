## Project objectives

Objective of our project is to create a Morse code transmitter. Our approach is that user will select a character from alphabet that will be translated and displayed on NEXYS A7-50T 7 segment display. Transmitter will be in state of inputting, in this state a yellow LED shining. After selecting desired character, user can trasmit by pressing a button. After the press of a button state will be changed to transmitting which will be indicated by LEDs color changing to green. After trasmitting inputed character there will be a 2s pause indicatd by a red light. From this state transmitter will go back to inputting state and process can be repeated.

This way user can transmit characters represented by morse code.
